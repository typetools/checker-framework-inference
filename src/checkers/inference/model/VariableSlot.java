 * VariableSlot is a Slot representing an undetermined value (i.e. a variable we are solving for).
 * After the Solver is run, each VariableSlot should have an assigned value which is then written
 * to the output Jaif file for later reinsertion into the original source code.
 *
 * Before the Solver is run, VariableSlots are represented by @VarAnnot( slot id ) annotations
 * on AnnotatedTypeMirrors.  When an AnnotatedTypeMirror is encountered in a position that would
 * generate constraints (e.g. either side of an assignment ), its @VarAnnots are converted into
 * VariableSlots which are then used in the generated constraints.
 *
 * E.g.  @VarAnnot(0) String s;
 * The above example implies that a VariableSlot with id 0 represents the possible annotations
 * on the declaration of s.
