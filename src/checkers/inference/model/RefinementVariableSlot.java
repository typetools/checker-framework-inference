/**
 * RefinementVariableSlots represent a potential downward refinement of an existing VariableSlot.  For each
 * RefinementVariableSlot, R, there exists a VariableSlot, V, with which it shares the following subtype
 * relationship:
 * R <: V
 *
 * Refinement variables are used to model the semantics of flow-sensitive type refinement
 * (http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/checkers-manual.html#type-refinement).
 *
 * Within methods, the values of fields, parameters, and local variables are all refined downward when possible ( e.g.
 * after an assignment ).  To model this behavior, every time a variable could possibly be refined downward we generate
 * a RefinementVariableSlot which is then used in all constraints for which the refinement holds.
 *
 * E.g.
 * The notation @X where X is an integer is used to identify individual VariableSlots below.  Each @X
 * corresponds to locations where @VarAnnot(X) would be placed and identifies trees corresponding to the
 * Variable slot with id X.
 *
 * Using the Nullness type-system:
 *
 *  class RefVarExample {
 *
 *      private @0 String myField = null;
 *
 *      void method( ) {
 *          @1 String s = myField;
 *          myField = "not null";   // This line results in a RefinementVariable @2
 *          s = myField;            // This line results in a RefinementVariable @3
 *      }
 *    }
 *
 *  In the example above the statement:
 *      @1 String s = myField;
 *  will generate the following subtype constraint:
 *      @0 <: @1
 *
 *  At this point in method, nothing is known about myField except for the information given by it's declaration.
 *  However, after the statement:
 *      myField = "not null";
 *  we know explicitly that myField is now not null and data-flow would refine @0 to @NonNull.  Any location in
 *  which this type of refinement is possible, usually at all method local assignments and potentially at the
 *  branches of if statements, we generate refinement variables.
 *
 *  Therefore, the assignment
 *      myField = "not null"
 *  results in a refinement variable @2 with the following constraints:
 *    @2 <: @0
 *    @2 <: ConstantSlot( NonNull )
 *
 *  Note, that even though @2 and @0 represent annotations on the same declared variable, @2's value might be different
 *  than @1 as they represent the possible type of the variable in different locations.  For instance, the line:
 *  s = myField;
 *  generates the following subtype constraints:
 *    @2 <: @1
 *
 *  Essentially, RefinementVariableSlots allow us to generate constraints as if the code were written in
 *  SSA form ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form ).
