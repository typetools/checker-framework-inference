Continuous integration status of master:

Checker Framework Inference
===========================

This project is a general type inference framework,
built upon the [Checker Framework](https://checkerframework.org/).

Given a program with no type annotations, Checker Framework Inference produces a program with type annotations.

By contrast, given a program with type annotations, the Checker Framework determines verifies the program's correctness or reveals errors in it.


Developer Notes
===============

If you want to extend the framework for your own type system or add
additional constraint solvers, please send us mail.

The checker-framework-inference Google Drive folder contains
additional documents for developers:

That information is being moved to here in the repository.


Configure Eclipse to edit Checker Framework Inference
------------

The instructions here assumes you have cloned this project into a folder called `checker-framework-inference`.

1) Follow the instructions in the [Checker Framework Manual](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#building-eclipse)
to download, build, and configure Eclipse to edit the Checker Framework. The Checker Framework Inference Eclipse
project depends on the eclipse projects from Checker Framework.

2) Follow the instructions below to build Checker Framework Inference

3) Build the dependencies jar file:

````
./gradlew dependenciesJar
````

4) Enter the main Eclipse working screen and in the “File” menu, select “Import” -> “General” -> “Existing Projects into workspace”.
After the “Import Projects” window appears, select “Select Root Directory”, and select the `checker-framework-inference` directory.
Eclipse should successfully build all the imported projects.

Requirements
===============

You will need a JDK (version 8) and Gradle.

Following the instructions in the Checker Framework manual to install the Checker Framework from source.

NOTE: Gradle on Ubuntu 14.10 hard-codes JAVA_HOME. To change this, edit
    `/usr/share/gradle/bin/gradle`
and replace

````
    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java
````

with

````
    [ -n "$JAVA_HOME" ] || export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java
````


Building
--------

To build:

````
./gradlew dist
````


Execution
---------

Verify you have all of the requirements.

````
./scripts/inference
````

is the script used to run inference.

Example:

````
./scripts/inference --logLevel FINE --mode ROUNDTRIP --checker ostrusted.OsTrustedChecker --solver checkers.inference.solver.PropagationSolver -afud /path/to/Annotation/File/Utilities/output/directory [List of files]
````

There are a couple of required options:

* `--mode`
Specifies what the tools should do.
Available options are [INFER, TYPECHECK, ROUNDTRIP, ROUNDTRIP_TYPECHECK]

  * `INFER`:
    Generates and solves the constraints and writes the results to default.jaif file

  * `TYPECHECK`:
    Typechecks the existin code

  * `ROUNDTRIP`:
    Generates and solves the constraints and then inserts the results
    back into the original source code

  * `ROUNDTRIP_TYPECHECK`:
    Executes roundtrip and then typechecks the result

* `--checker`
Specifies which checker to run.
The two most supported checkers at the moment are
`checkers.ostrusted.OsTrustedChecker` and
`checkers.tainting.TaintingChecker`

* `--solver`
Which solver to use on the constraints.

* `--targetclasspath`
The classpath that is required by target program.

`checkers.inference.solver.PropagationSolver` is the only real solver
at the moment.
TODO: update

Omiting the solver will create an output that numbers all of the
annotation positions in the program.

`checkers.inference.solver.DebugSolver` will output all of the
constraints generated.


Other options can be found by `./scripts/inference --help`.
