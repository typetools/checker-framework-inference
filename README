Checker Framework Inference README
==================================

This project aims to provide a general type inference framework
for the Checker Framework.

A developer guide pdf can be found in the docs folder.

PLSE member can view the checker-framework-inference drive folder.

All suggestions for improvements are very welcome!

If you want to extend the framework for your own type system or add
additional constraint solvers, please send me a mail!


Installation
------------

You will need a JDK and gradle.
I usually use OpenJDK 7.

Install the source-versions of these three tools:

http://types.cs.washington.edu/jsr308/
http://types.cs.washington.edu/annotation-file-utilities/
http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/

Put all of them into a common directory.
Make sure that all tools are compiled correctly and that all Checker
Framework test cases work.

You will now need to install a type system to infer. Try the Generic
Universe Type system first and then adapt it to your own type system.

All the projects are easy to use from Eclipse. Create one workspace
for all projects and import the existing project configurations.
Contributions of make, Ant, and Maven scripts would be greatly
appreciated.

To download the dependent jars to the dist folder:
gradle dist
